# Probability

**Learning objectives:**

Understand the *slogan*:

>Probability is a measure of the size of a set

- Review basic set theory

- Learn mathematical probability as a measure on sets

- Learn conditional probability


## Motivating example {-}

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/prob_measure_set.jpg")`

Roll 1 a die, what is the probability of getting a number < 4 and even?

- Set of possible results is {1,2,3,4,5,6} is the *sample space*

- Two events of interest, as sets: 

    $E_1 = \{1,2,3\}$ ('less then 4') 
    
    $E_2 = \{2,4,6\}$ ('even') 
    
- Combined, even *and* less then 5 is the *intersection* of E1 and E2:

    $E = E_1 \cap  E_2 = \{2\}$

- The probability is the *measure* of E relative to the the sample space, here $1/6$ since the measure here is just a *counter*.


## Set Theory

- A set is a collection of elements ($\{\xi_1, \xi_2, ..., \xi_n\}$)

- Elements can be anything... apples, real numbers, functions, sets!

- B is a *subset* of A, denoted $B \subseteq A$ if every member of B is also a member of A. 

```{r}
A <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
B <- c(2,4,6)
all(B %in% A)
all(A %in% B)
```

## $\Omega$ and $\emptyset$ {-}

- A set with no elements: $\emptyset$

- The universal set ($\Omega$) is the set containing all elements under consideration. 

  - Relative concept! 
  
  - For probability theory, this will be the *sample space*

## Set Operations {-}

Union: $A \cup B = \{\xi \mid \xi \in A \text{ or } \xi \in B\}$

Intersection $A \cap B = \{\xi \mid \xi \in A \text{ and } \xi \in B\}$
 
Complement: $A^c = \{\xi \mid \xi \in \Omega \text{ and } \xi \notin A\} = \Omega \setminus A$

Note the correspondence with logic: and, or, not

Difference:  $A\setminus B = \{\xi \mid \xi \in A \text{ and } \xi \notin B\} = A \cap B^c$ 

```{r}
A <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
B <- c(2,4,6)
union(A,B)
intersect(A,B)
setdiff(A,B)
```
## Important Properties {-}

- $\cap$ and $cup$ are *commutative* (Order does not matter) and *associative* (move parens around)

- Distribution:

$$
A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)\\
A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)
$$
- De Morgan's law:

$$
(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c\\
(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c
$$

 
## Disjoint and Partition {-}

- Two sets $A$ and $B$ are *disjoint* if $A\cap B = \emptyset$

- A collection of sets $\{A_1,A_2,...,A_n\}$ is a *partition* of $\Omega$ if:

   1. Disjoint: $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$
   2. Decompose:  $\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i = \Omega$

- This is important because it allows us to decompose $\Omega$ into smaller subsets to analyze separately.

Example  $\{1,3,4\}$, $\{4,5\}$ and $\{6\}$ form a partition of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$

## Probability Space

Three elements constitute a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$

   1. $\Omega$, the *sample space*, the set of all possible outcomes.
   
   2. $\mathcal{F}$, the *event space*,   $E \subseteq \Omega$
   
   3. $\mathbb{P}$ , the probability law, a *measure* mapping from an event E to number $\mathbb{P}[E]$ that satisfies the *axioms* of probability.
